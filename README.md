# shadergraphgame

Testing with a custom shader made using shader-graph to create a skybox.
Run the project to see the sky transition between different times of day.
SkyController has the TimeSpeed variable which controls the speed of the day.

TextFiles/SkyKeyFrames contains key frames for times and colour settings.

Mostly based off of this tutorial: https://medium.com/@jannik_boysen/procedural-skybox-shader-137f6b0cb77c (24/10/2022)
